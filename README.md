# cpp-modules

This repository contains the C++ modules exercises completed as part of the 42 school curriculum.

## Overview

The 42 C++ modules cover fundamental concepts of C++ (OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exceptions, etc.) through a series of progressive exercises.  
Each folder corresponds to a module, and each module contains several exercises to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> PmergeMe is 100% correct and almost mathematically perfect.

> Try debug mode to gain a much better understanding of how it works.

> [!WARNING]
> CPP 04 to 06 is not necessarily up to date.

> Apparently, Scalar converter works, but be careful, the subject would require something else.

## Repository Structure

- `cppXX/`: folders for each module (e.g., `cpp00`, `cpp01`, ...)
- Each module contains subfolders or files for each exercise.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
- UNIX environment (Linux, macOS)
- Make (to use the provided Makefiles)
---
# Build & Run

Navigate to the desired module folder, then compile with:

```bash
-> make
```
## Run PmergeMe in Debug mode
```bash
-> cd cpp-modules/cpp09/ex02
-> make debug
-> PmergeMe compiled with debug for MacOS/Linux âœ…
-> ./PmergeMe
-> Usage: ./PmergeMe[DEBUG] "1 94 42 323 424" [DEBUG_MODE: 1,2,3]
```
You can also use tester
```bash
-> ./pmergme_tester_linux.bash
-> ./pmergme_tester_macos.bash
-> ./pmergme_tester_linux_valgrind.bash
```
