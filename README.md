# cpp-modules

This repository contains the C++ modules exercises completed as part of the 42 school curriculum.

## Overview

The 42 C++ modules cover fundamental concepts of C++ (OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exceptions, etc.) through a series of progressive exercises.  
Each folder corresponds to a module, and each module contains several exercises to complete.

## Repository Structure

- `moduleXX/`: folders for each module (e.g., `module00`, `module01`, ...)
- Each module contains subfolders or files for each exercise.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
- UNIX environment (Linux, macOS)
- Make (to use the provided Makefiles)

## Build & Run

Navigate to the desired module folder, then compile with:

```bash
make
```

To run a specific exercise, refer to the README inside the module or the official subject.

## Subjects

The exercise subjects are available on the 42 intranet.
